== Authentication via HTTP headers

On the former security-proxy, there was a mechanism called "SP-trust-SP"
which basically allowed to leave the authentication and authorization
to another component placed before the security-proxy. The authentication
would then be performed by using HTTP headers.

The gateway implements a similar feature, and this can be activated
by configuring the gateway using the following:

```yaml
georchestra:
  gateway:
    security:
      header-authentication:
        enabled: true
```

The following headers are expected to be received by the Gateway:

* `sec-georchestra-preauthenticated`: set to `true`
* `preauth-username`: set to the username / user identifier (e.g. "pmauduit")
* `preauth-email`: the email address of the user (e.g. "pierre.mauduit@example.org")
* `preauth-firstname`: the first name of the user (e.g. "Pierre")
* `preauth-lastname`: the surname of the user (e.g. "Mauduit")
* `preauth-org`: the organisation identifier (e.g. "geOrchestra")

== Charset considerations & encoded headers

As the framework will consider the received headers as pure `us-ascii`, this can lead to issues when values contain
accented characters. To circumvent this, it is possible to
configure the gateway to receive base64-encoded http headers.

If the headers values are prefixed with `{base64}`, then the `gateway` will
base64-decode the HTTP headers' values  - apart from the `sec-georchestra-preauthenticated` which should still be set to `true` as plaintext - before using them.

== Account creation

In order to be able to administer users who are using the pre-authentication mechanism,
an account is created into the geOrchestra OpenLDAP, if available in the gateway configuration.

The account creation must be explicitly activated using the following yaml configuration:

```
georchestra:
  gateway:
    security:
      header-authentication:
        enabled: true
      createNonExistingUsersInLDAP: true
```

To create the user into the geOrchestra LDAP, a `default` & `extended` LDAP must be
defined, and you generally need read/write access to it, meaning that the `adminDn` and `adminPassword` have to be provided in the configuration.

Below is a configuration example snippet
suitable for your `application.yml` gateway configuration file:

```
georchestra:
  gateway:
    security:
      header-authentication:
        enabled: true
      ldap:
        default:
          enabled: true
          extended: true
          url: ldap://georchestra-ldap:389/
          baseDn: dc=georchestra,dc=org
          adminDn: cn=admin,dc=georchestra,dc=org
          adminPassword: secret
          users:
            rdn: ou=users
            searchFilter: (uid={0})
            pendingUsersSearchBaseDN: ou=pendingusers
            protectedUsers: geoserver_privileged_user
          roles:
            rdn: ou=roles
            searchFilter: (member={0})
            protectedRoles: ADMINISTRATOR, EXTRACTORAPP, GN_.*, ORGADMIN, REFERENT, USER, SUPERUSER
          orgs:
            rdn: ou=orgs
            orgTypes: Association,Company,NGO,Individual,Other
            pendingOrgSearchBaseDN: ou=pendingorgs
```

== Security considerations

As the HTTP headers can be controlled by the remote user issuing the query, it is *mandatory* to have your gateway inaccessible directly ; on such setup, it must be placed behind another proxy component which will take care of sanitizing the incoming requests.

You can find a documented configuration sample of an Apache webserver which makes use of the `mod_mellon` to interact with the Renater federation.

== Renater configuration sample

The following Apache configuration has been used in a setup to interact with the Renater federation:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName https://georchestra.example.org:443/
      UseCanonicalName On

      ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
      DocumentRoot /var/www/html

      ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
      CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        MellonEndpointPath /mellon

        # it is this proxy's responsability to make sure the value of these headers are legit

        RequestHeader unset sec-georchestra-preauthenticated
        RequestHeader unset preauth-username
        RequestHeader unset preauth-email
        RequestHeader unset preauth-firstname
        RequestHeader unset preauth-lastname
        RequestHeader unset preauth-org

        # The following ones are used by geOrchestra
        # You can find a list of headers here:
        # https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/blob/master/commons/src/main/java/org/georchestra/commons/security/SecurityHeaders.java#L41-L67
        RequestHeader unset sec-proxy
        RequestHeader unset sec-user
        RequestHeader unset sec-organization
        RequestHeader unset sec-userid
        RequestHeader unset sec-lastupdated
        RequestHeader unset sec-roles
        RequestHeader unset sec-firstname
        RequestHeader unset sec-lastname
        RequestHeader unset sec-tel
        RequestHeader unset sec-orgid
        RequestHeader unset sec-orgname
        RequestHeader unset sec-org-lastupdated
        RequestHeader unset imp-roles
        RequestHeader unset imp-username

        RequestHeader set sec-georchestra-preauthenticated true "expr=-n env('MELLON_NAME_ID')"
        RequestHeader set preauth-username %{MELLON_EPPN}e "expr=-n env('MELLON_EPPN')"
        RequestHeader set preauth-email %{MELLON_MAIL}e "expr=-n env('MELLON_MAIL')"
        RequestHeader set preauth-firstname %{MELLON_GIVEN_NAME}e "expr=-n env('MELLON_GIVEN_NAME')"
        RequestHeader set preauth-lastname %{MELLON_SN}e "expr=-n env('MELLON_SN')"
        RequestHeader set preauth-org %{MELLON_O}e "expr=-n env('MELLON_O')"
        # If needed to base64-encode the headers because of them containing accented characters, you can
        # use the following syntax and adapt the other headers above:
        # RequestHeader set preauth-lastname "expr={base64}%{base64:%{env:MELLON_SN}}"   "expr=-n env('MELLON_SN')"

        ProxyPass "http://georchestra-gateway-svc:8080/"
        ProxyPassReverse "http://georchestra-gateway-svc:8080/"
        ProxyPreserveHost On
    </Location>

    <Location /login/renater>
        AuthType Mellon
        MellonEnable auth
        Require valid-user
        Redirect "/"
    </Location>

</VirtualHost>
```

You can see that Apache is taking care of sanitizing the request with the multiple calls to `RequestHeader unset` before setting them to a value provided by the `mod_mellon` if available, else they are kept unset.

The second `Location` allows to trigger an authentication when hitting the `/login/renater` endpoint, which is linked onto a custom login page of the gateway.

== sample docker composition

A docker composition is provided at the root of the repository which integrates a simple Nginx as the frontend proxy. It can be launched using:

```
$ docker compose -f docker-compose-preauth.yaml up
```

With the provided `datadir/nginx-preauth/nginx.conf` configuration, it should make you logged in as `testadmin` without having to login.
