**georChestra Gateway** is a https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/docs/current/reference/html/[Spring Cloud Gateway]
service acting as the single entry point to back-end georChestra applications, handling authentication and authorization
on their behalf.

== Introduction

The following diagram provides a high-level overview of how Spring Cloud Gateway works:

        filter_chain-->proxy_filter(Proxy Filter)
    end
    client(Web Client)-->handler_mapping(Handler Mapping)
    proxy_filter-->proxied_service(Proxied Services)
----

Clients make requests to the Gateway. If the Gateway Handler Mapping determines that a request
matches a route, it is sent to the Gateway Web Handler.
This handler runs the request through a filter chain that is specific to the request.
Filters can run logic both before and after the proxy request is sent. All “pre” filter
logic is executed. Then the proxy request is made. After the proxy request is made,
the “post” filter logic is run.

**RemoveSecurityHeadersGatewayFilter** removes any incoming `sec-\*` request header to
prevent impersonation. Valid `sec-*` headers ought to be computed by the filter chain
and appended to proxied requests.

**ResolveTargetGlobalFilter** resolves the `GeorchestraTargetConfig`
for the request's matched `Route` and stores as a `ServerWebExchange` attribute.
`GeorchestraTargetConfig` contains the target service's security header requirements
and the set of role-based access rules to different service endpoints.

**ResolveGeorchestraUserGlobalFilter** resolves the `GeorchestraUser` from the
request's `Authentication` so it can be retrieved down the chain during a server
web exchange filter chain execution.
The resolved per-request `GeorchestraUser` object can then, for
example, be used to append the necessary `sec-*` headers that relate
to user information to proxied http requests.

**AddSecHeadersGatewayFilter** adds all necessary `sec-*` request  headers to proxied requests.
Delegates to the `HeaderContributor` extension point to prepare the exact set of headers to append
to each request.

Implementations can use the resolved `GeorchestraTargetConfig` and `GeorchestraUser` to compute 
the target service required header names and values.

== Data directory property sources

Routes and other relevant configuration properties are loaded from geOrchestra "data directory"'s
`default.properties` and `gateway/gateway.yaml`.

The location of the data directory is picked up from the `georchestra.datadir` environment property,
and the additional property sources by means of spring-boot's 
`spring.config.import` environment property, like in:
`spring.config.import: ${georchestra.datadir}/default.properties,${georchestra.datadir}/gateway/gateway.yaml`.
